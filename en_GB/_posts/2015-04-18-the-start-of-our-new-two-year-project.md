# The implementation of measures for the European souslik in South Moravia

As part of our project, "The implementation of measures for the European souslik in South Moravia" we recently went to monitor the population of ground squirrels at Miroslav airport and mapped souslik occurrence in the Kyjovská pahorkatina vineyards and orchards. Occurrence has only been confirmed only in the vicinity of the village of Velké Pavlovice. In the other areas, after talking to local members of the public, it seems as though the ground quirrel was last seen ten, twenty, thirty… years ago :-(.
