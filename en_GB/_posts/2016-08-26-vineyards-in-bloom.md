# Blooming vineyards

Vineyards with grassy lines are one of the main conditions when winemarker eligibility for the Sysli na Vinici trademark. They provide a home not only to our rare ground squirrels, but also to a wide range of plants and animals. In summer, the vineyards can turn into flowering meadows. We took advantage of this looking for ground squirrels and photographed them for you :)
