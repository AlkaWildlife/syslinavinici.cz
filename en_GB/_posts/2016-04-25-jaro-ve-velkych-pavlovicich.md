As part of our occurance mapping session this spring, we took a variety of photos in the vineyards of Velké Pavlovice. Grassy lines between vines is essential for ground squirrels and is becoming common place across Velké Pavlovice. This is not the case, however, for all wine-growing areas.

In Velké Pavlovice, though, ground squirrels have not won yet. The individuals which do live here, don't live in densely populated colonies as in other localities, but are scattered and potentially isolated from each other. We do not yet know why this is the case and how it will affects the population, it is still a mystery to us how males and females get together and reproduced here every year.
