The main source of food for ground squirrels are the various parts of different herbs and grasses. Fruits, however, can be a very energetic, supplementary food source, available at a critical time of the year when they are preparing for their winter hibernation. Ground squirrels metabolism is quite remarkable as in a short period, just before they go to sleep for the winter, they gain fat deposits by losing half their body weight. This subcutaneous fat is then gradually consumed throughout the seven months they spend hibernating.

Nowadays, trees are scattered across our agricultural landscape which has become a less favourable habitat for ground squirrels. Orchards, however, are an area where ground squirrels can thrive due to grassy meadows in-between trees and also the opportunity to consume ripe fruit. As their name suggests, ground squirrels live on the ground and do not climb trees yet they will take advantage of any fallen fruits they find on the ground. They will also build burrows under or nearby trees to keep close to the fruit. From the end of July to September, ground squirrels slowly return underground for hibernation. First to hibernation are the males and females which did not have young in that year, second to hibernate are the females which did raise young in that year and eventually, the last to hibernate are the young born earlier in the year. This all depends on how successful they have been in fatten up for the winter. Since June they search for highly calorific foods so foods such as cherries and apricots which ripen in the early summer can be a vital aspect relating to their overwintering survival.

Although there is a limited number of fruit trees in our agricultural landscape, the ones left are absolutely amazing. Like any tree, they provide shade, habitat for many different species such as beetles, birds nest in their hollows and branches, and they also provide fruit for humans, ground squirrels and other animals. With all this in mind, we organised tree planting across two different areas. In the autumn of 2019 five fruit trees were planted on the outskirts of the local airport in Miroslav and 15 trees in the terraces of Velké Pavlovice. Members of the [Aeroklubu Miroslav](https://aeroklub-miroslav.webnode.cz/) and [Vinařství Krejčiřík](http://www.vinarstvi-krejcirik.cz/) from Velké Pavlovice kindly planted the trees and will also take care of the trees in the future.

So which fruit trees are best? Initially, it is advised to vary the types of trees planted so there is a variety of fruit yet also variety in when the fruits are ripe. This means the ground squirrels have access to more supplementary food across a longer period of time. For example, trees such as Burlat cherry or Wild cherry ripen early in the season whilst Kaštánka ripen later in June. After this, throughout July apricots start to ripen. Also, early ripening pears or apples with small fruits such as Nagevic or Krvavka may also be suitable.

_This action was completed with the project Sousliks for the landscape, landscape for sousliks - Monitoring and supporting the population of European ground squirrel in South Moravia II. Funded from ERDF / state budget. It is also published with the support of the Ministry of the Environment (MoE). The project does not have to express the views of the MoE._
