# The first wine bar in the capital with our Sysli na Vinici trademark! 

Until Christmas, you can buy wine, all awarded the Sysle na Vinici trademark, sourced from five different wineries at the Cellarius wine bar. 

Yesterday, Tereza Mináriková spoke about the ground squirrel and Denisa Novotná spoke about the wine while we tasted!
