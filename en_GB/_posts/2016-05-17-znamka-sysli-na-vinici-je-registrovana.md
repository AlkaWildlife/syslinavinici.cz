Our new trademark "Sysli na vinici" has been registered with the Industrial Property Office and will be awarded to winemakers who have rare ground squirrels in their vineyards.

The trademark is awarded by [ALKA Wildlife, o.p.s.](https://www.alkawildlife.eu/) and [Karlovy Vary Museum](http://www.kvmuz.cz/) who are conducting research on sousliks in the Czech Republic.

The first stamps will be awarded to winemakers in June 2016.

You can recognise the wine from the ground squirrel friendly vineyard by the golden trademark on each bottle.
