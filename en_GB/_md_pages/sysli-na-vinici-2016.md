**Project title**: Sysli na vinici

**Project duration**: 07–11 2016

**Financial support**: Ministry of the Environment, within the project "Promotion of rescue programmes for specially protected species in the Czech Republic" implemented by [Beleco, z.s.](http://www.beleco.cz)

The project was financially supported through a grant from the Ministry of the Environment but does not have to express the opinions of the Ministry of the Environment.

**Project manager**: Kateřina Poledníková

European ground squirrels or sousliks are considered one of the most endangered mammals in Europe. Once a common inhabitant of lowland grasslands in the Czech Republic, their conservation status for the Czech Republic is now critically endangered status, limited to around 35 isolated communities. Sousliks are threatened primarily by changes in the Czech and Moravian landscape: land consolidation, agricultural intensification and also, on the contrary, the abandonment of land such as meadows and pastures. These changes have destroyed sousliks natural environment: short grassland. Currently, most souslik communities live on small isolated grassland sites such as campsites, golf courses, airports and a few in the natural steppe. 

In recent years, however, the number of sousliks has increased in the mosaic, agricultural landscape of South Moravia which consists of vineyards, orchards and embankments. These environments have potential in providing suitable souslik habitat and increasing the chance of interconnection between individual souslik localities. These vineyards present a real potential basis for a functional metapopulation - the creation of 5 metapopulation systems of souslik occurrence is one of the long-term objectives of the rescue programme. The vineyards, however, are not always a suitable environment for sousliks. Maintenance of the rows between vines is key to sousliks success in these environments and this is where increased communication with the winemakers is vital.

The project aims to protect sousliks and educate the general public about their present in vineyards. We will do this by awarding the trade mark "Souslik friendly vineyard" to winemakers. This trademark has been registered as part of the project “Implementation of the Action Plan measures in the South Moravia”. The first action has already taken place in the largest population of sousliks in Velké Pavlovice.
