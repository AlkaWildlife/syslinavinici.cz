To support wine growers and raise public awareness of sousliks, we created the “**Sysli na Vinici**” trademark meaning “**Souslik friendly Vineyard**”. This can be awarded to winemakers who manage their vineyards in a way that is friendly to both sousliks and the environment. By buying their wine you can also support the protection of this rare species. 

This trademark was registered with the Industrial Property Office in 2016. 

A trademark can be given to a vineyard where:

1. Occurrence of sousliks living within the vineyard for the given year has been proven
2. The vineyards are maintained in a way that is both souslik and environmentally friendly.

Specifically, the minimum requirements are: 

* At least every second row of the vineyard is grassy
* The viticulturist does not endanger the sousliks through the use of pesticides such as rodenticides

Currently, [21 wineries](/souslik-stamp/our-wineries) from the villages of Velké Pavlovice, Hnanice and Miroslav have been awarded the trademark.
