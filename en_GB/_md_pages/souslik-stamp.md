Sousliks, once a common species in the Czech Republic, are now critically endangered and considered one of the most endangered mammals in Europe. Habitats like vineyards, orchards and other areas in South Moravia, areas less affected by the intensification of farming, are essential for the future of this endangered species.

To support wine growers and raise public awareness of sousliks, we created the “**Sysli na vinici**” trademark meaning “**Souslik friendly vineyard**”. This can be awarded to winemakers who manage their vineyards in a way that is friendly to both sousliks and the environment. By buying their wine you can support the protection of this rare species. 

This trademark was registered with the Industrial Property Office in 2016. 

A trademark can be given to a vineyard where:

1. Occurrence of sousliks living within the vineyard for the given year has been proven
2. The vineyards are maintained in a way that is both souslik and environmentally friendly. Specifically, the minimum requirements are: 

* At least every second row of the vineyard is grassy
* The viticulturist tolerates the sousliks and does not use pesticides such as rodenticides

Currently, [21 wineries](/souslik-stamp/our-wineries) from the villages of Velké Pavlovice, Hnanice and Miroslav have been awarded the trademark.

Following the success of our Sysli na vinici trademark, we created the “**Sysli v sadu**” trademark - meaning “**Souslik friendly orchard**”. This can be awarded to orchard owners who manage their orchards in a way that is friendly to both sousliks and the environment. By buying their fruits and other produce from their orchards, you can support the protection of this rare species. 

This trademark was registered with the Industrial Property Office in 2018.

A trademark can be given to an orchard which:

1. Proves occurrence of sousliks living within the orchard for the given year
2. The orchards are maintained in a way that is both souslik and environmentally friendly. 

Currently, the first orchard to receive a stamp is [Hrušovan](/souslik-stamp/our-orchards) near Brno. 

Stamps are awarded by [ALKA Wildlife, ops.](https://www.alkawildlife.eu) All activities associated with Sysli na vinici and Sysli v sadu are funded from EEA and ERDF funds and the state budget. For more details see our [projects](/projects) page.
