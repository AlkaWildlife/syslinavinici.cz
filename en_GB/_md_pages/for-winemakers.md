Winemakers - do you have sousliks in your vineyard? Be proud of them - it's a real rarity! The souslik is considered one of the most endangered mammals in Europe. Help us, we can protect it together!

We have created the trademark "Souslik friendly vineyard" for winemakers who keep their vineyards a great environment for their sousliks.

The trademark is awarded by [ALKA Wildlife, o.p.s.](https://www.alkawildlife.eu/) together with the [Karlovy Vary Museum](http://www.kvmuz.cz/), the partners who are conducting research of the sousliks in the Czech Republic.

# HOW DO I GET A TRADEMARK FOR MY WINE?

A trademark can be obtained for a vineyard which:

1) Can prove occurrence of sousliks living within the vineyard for the given grape year 

2) The vineyard is maintained in a way that is both souslik and environmentally friendly. 

Specifically, the minimum requirements for this are: 

\- At least every second row of the vineyard is grassed and

\- The viticulturist tolerates the sousliks and does not use pesticides such as rodenticides

[Here](/souslik-stamp/our-wineries) you can find a list of vineyards where sousliks have been confirmed and the award has been given. 

If you would like to obtain the _Sysli na Vinci_ trademark and display the stickers on your bottles, at your cellar and provide information leaflets to display and distribute to members of the public, please [get in contact](/about-us/contacts). You can also discuss reporting sightings of sousliks as well.
