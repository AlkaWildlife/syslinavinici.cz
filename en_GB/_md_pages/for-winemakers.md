Winemakers - do you have sousliks in your vineyard? Be proud of them - it's a real rarity! Sousliks are considered one of the most endangered mammals in Europe. Help us, we can protect them together. We  created the trademark _Sysli na Vinici_ for winemakers who maintain their vineyards with sousliks in mind.

The trademark is awarded by [ALKA Wildlife, o.p.s.](https://www.alkawildlife.eu/) and [Karlovy Vary Museum](http://www.kvmuz.cz/) who are conducting research on sousliks in the Czech Republic.

# HOW DO I GET A TRADEMARK FOR MY WINE?

A trademark can be given to a vineyard where:

1. Occurrence of sousliks living within the vineyard for the given year has been proven
2. The vineyards are maintained in a way that is both souslik and environmentally friendly.

Specifically, the minimum requirements are: 

* At least every second row of the vineyard is grassy
* The viticulturist does not endangered the sousliks through the use of pesticides such as rodenticides

[Here](/souslik-stamp/our-wineries) you can find a list of vineyards which have been awarded this special mark.

If you would like to obtain the _Sysli na Vinci_ trademark and display the stickers on your bottles, at your cellar and provide information leaflets for visitors to your wine cellars, please [get in contact](/about-us/contacts).
