Winemakers - do you have sousliks in your vineyard? Be proud of them - it's a real rarity! Sousliks are considered one of the most endangered mammals in Europe. Help us, we can protect them together. We  created the trademark _Sysli na Vinici_ for winemakers who maintain their vineyards with sousliks in mind.

The trademark is awarded by [ALKA Wildlife, o.p.s.](https://www.alkawildlife.eu/) and [Karlovy Vary Museum](http://www.kvmuz.cz/) who are conducting research on sousliks in the Czech Republic.

# HOW DO I GET A TRADEMARK FOR MY WINE?

A trademark can be obtained for a vineyard which:

1. Can prove occurrence of sousliks living within the vineyard for the given grape year 
2. The vineyard is maintained in a way that is both souslik and environmentally friendly. 

Specifically, the minimum requirements for this are: 

\- At least every second row of the vineyard is grassed and

\- The viticulturist tolerates the sousliks and does not use pesticides such as rodenticides

[Here](/souslik-stamp/our-wineries) you can find a list of vineyards where sousliks have been confirmed and the award has been given. 

If you would like to obtain the _Sysli na Vinci_ trademark and display the stickers on your bottles, at your cellar and provide information leaflets to display and distribute to members of the public, please [get in contact](/about-us/contacts). You can also discuss reporting sightings of sousliks as well.
