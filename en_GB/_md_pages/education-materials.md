Have fun trying to remember where the pairs are. Just print out the pictures on thick A4 paper, turn them around and print the last page on the back. Cut them out, shuffle, and try and find the matching pairs!

[Souslik quiz](https://en.syslinavinici.cz/media/sysel_kviz.pdf) (pdf) (Czech)

We've created this small quiz about sousliks you can play at home or in the classroom. You can easily play this outside by creating a map of where the questions are. Page 2 can be printed as many times as you like. All other pages should be printed back to front and cut out (except the A4 pages!). We've also provided the answers in more depth on the last two pages.
